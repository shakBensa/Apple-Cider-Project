            <p className='about' >Hey,my name is Shaked and I've been producing music for over a decade. <br />
                In 2020 I've released my first track and even though I had years of exprience I was worrying about what kind of feedback I will recieve. <br />
                Fortunatly,this release got endoresed by amazing ChillHop & Lofi Curators such as 
                <a className='endorsements' href="https://www.instagram.com/chillselect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Chill Select</a>,
                <a className='endorsements' href="https://www.thebeatforest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> The Beatforest</a>,

                and many more awesome people that helped my music get heard along the way. <br />
                <br />Since then I've amassed over 400K streams on Spotify. <br />There is no "End Goal" for me at the moment. <br />
                The feeling I get when I make beats is unmatched,<br />
                I do it for the love and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.
